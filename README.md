## Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's triangle with React.

### Pointers to improve:

1. Presentation components can be functional because they don't have state.
2. Save action types in variables
3. Does PascalsTriangleContainer.js need to have access to rows?
4. Could calculatePascalsTriangle use a unit test? Could your actions and reducers as well?
5. Do you need to have a root reducer, with different reducer functions?
6. How do you prevent the UI from making rows negative?
7. How can you make the triangle more visually appealing?
